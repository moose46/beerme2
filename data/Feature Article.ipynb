Told me to pick it up and regrind it and package it for sale. I cleaned up the best I could and repackaged it, and put in out in the cooler. When someone would come up to buy it I warned them about what I had done. Next thing I know the intercom for the store, crackled Bob please come to the front office please. They handed me a check and told me I had a big mouth and fired me on the spot, Now I am in a pickle, can't get a full time job anywhere, because I have a 2 year cruise to complete for the Navy Reserves. Ask the Navy to get me a crusie quicker, no deal. Went down to the Air Force recruiter and singed up, guess to can move from one branch to another if it is reserve to active duty. Left the very next week to another boot camp (I am seasoned this time) for Lackland Airforce base."
